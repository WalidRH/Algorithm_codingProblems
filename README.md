Coding challenges

## Coding problem #1 -- [sum_number](https://github.com/WalidRH/Algorithm_codingProblems/tree/main/sum_number) --
This problem was recently asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

## Coding problem #2 -- [unival_tree](https://github.com/WalidRH/Algorithm_codingProblems/tree/main/unival_tree) --
This problem was asked by Google.

A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.
Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

## Coding problem #3 -- [The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm](https://github.com/WalidRH/Algorithm_codingProblems/tree/main/The_Sieve_of_Eratosthenes_algorithm)
This problem was asked by Square.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than N. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.

For example, to find all primes less than 100, we would first mark [4, 6, 8, ...] (multiples of two), then [6, 9, 12, ...] (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than N, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.

Implement this algorithm.
