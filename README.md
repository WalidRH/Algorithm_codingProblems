## Coding problem #1 -- [sum_number](https://github.com/WalidRH/Algorithm_codingProblems/tree/main/sum_number) --
This problem was recently asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
